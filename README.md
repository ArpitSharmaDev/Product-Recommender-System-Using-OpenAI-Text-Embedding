### Before Running This Code: Setting Up API Credentials

1. Locate the file named `apikey.env.template` in the root directory.
2. Rename it to `apikey.env.txt`.
3. Open `apikey.env.txt` and replace `sk-proj-....` with your actual API key. Your OpenAI API keys can be found at: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
4. If you do not have an organization ID, leave `ORGID` empty, as the API should work without it.

**Also, ensure you have available OpenAI credits** to avoid interruptions in accessing the API. You can check your credits here: https://platform.openai.com/usage

### Before Running This Code

1. **Make Sure You Have OpenAI Credits**:
   - You can check your available credits here: https://platform.openai.com/usage.

2. **Set Up API Credentials**:
   - Locate the file named `apikey.env.template` in the root directory.
   - Rename it to `apikey.env.txt`.
   - Open `apikey.env.txt` and replace `sk-proj-....` with your actual API key. Your OpenAI API keys can be found at: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys.
   - If you do not have an organization ID, leave `ORGID` empty, as the API should work without it.
